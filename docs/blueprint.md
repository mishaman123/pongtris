# **App Name**: Tetropong

## Core Features:

- Tetris Game: Implement Tetris game logic and rendering on the top half of the screen, controlled by arrow keys.
- Pong Game: Implement Pong game logic and rendering on the bottom half of the screen, controlled by 'A' and 'S' keys. A collision between the paddle and the ball should reverse the ball trajectory
- Game Logic and Scoring: Implement scoring based on Tetris line clears, and a game over condition when either the Tetris or Pong game is lost.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep blue (#1A237E) for the background to provide contrast.
- Secondary color: A bright cyan (#00BCD4) for the Tetris blocks and Pong paddle/ball to make them stand out.
- Accent: Use a vibrant lime green (#AEEA00) for the score display and game over messages.
- The Tetris game occupies the top half of the screen, and the Pong game occupies the bottom half, with a clear visual separator in between.
- Use simple, geometric shapes for the Tetris blocks and Pong elements for a clean look.
- Smooth transitions and animations for Tetris block movement and Pong ball reflection.
